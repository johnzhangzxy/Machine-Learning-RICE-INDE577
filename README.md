# Machine Learning INDE577 @ Rice University

Course taken at Rice University with Dr. Randy R. Davila, Assistant Professor of Data Science at University of Houston-Downtown and Adjunct Professor of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice Univeristy.

This is the homework repository associated with this course. 

### Course Description: 
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
Implemented many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. 

Topics include:

- **Supervised Learning**:
    - Model Building and Error Analysis
    - Gradient Descent - Regression
    - Gradient Descent - Logistic Regression
    - Neural Nets
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision/ Regression Trees
    - Ensemble Learning

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
    - k-Means Clustering
    - DBSCAN Clustering
    - Principle Component Analysis

- **Reinforcement Learning**:
    - Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods
 

The Python versions used in the course were 3.7 and higher.
