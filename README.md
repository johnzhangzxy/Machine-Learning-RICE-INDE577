# Machine_Learning_INDE577-Rice

Course taken at Rice University with Dr. Randy R. Davila, Adjunct Professor of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice Univeristy.

This is the homework repository associated with this course. 

### Course Description: 
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
Implemented many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. 

Topics include:

- **Supervised Learning**:
    - Model Building and Error Analysis
    - Linear Regression
    - Gradient Descent
    - Logistic Regression
    - Neural Nets
    - Support Vector Machines
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision/ Regression Trees
    - Ensemble Learning

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
    - k-Means Clustering
    - Principle Component Analysis

- **Reinforcement Learning**:
    - Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods
 

Used Python versions 3.6 and higher.
