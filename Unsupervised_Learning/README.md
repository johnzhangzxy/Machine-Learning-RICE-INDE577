# Unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository contains code and explanations for different unsupervised machine learning algorithms that I have implemented. Some algorithm is implemented using Python from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas. And some algorithms are also implemented using scikit-learn. The code is well documented and easy to follow.

## Algorithms

### K-Means

The K-Means algorithm is implemented using scikit-learn. The algorithm clusters the data into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and their corresponding cluster centers. The implementation includes an elbow plot to help determine the optimal number of clusters.

### DBSCAN

The DBSCAN algorithm is implemented using scikit-learn. The algorithm clusters the data based on density and identifies noise points. The implementation includes a parameter tuning section to determine the best values for the parameters.

### PCA

Principal component analysis (PCA) is implemented using scikit-learn. The algorithm finds the principal components of the data and reduces its dimensionality. The implementation includes a visualization of the explained variance ratio to help determine the optimal number of components.
