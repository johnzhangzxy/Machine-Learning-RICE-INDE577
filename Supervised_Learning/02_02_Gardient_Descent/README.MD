# Data Description

The dataset used in this Jupyter Notebook is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). It contains 569 samples with 30 numeric input features describing the characteristics of cell nuclei present in a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The objective is to predict if the cancer is benign (0) or malignant (1) based on these features.
