# Data Description

The dataset used in this Jupyter Notebook is the Fashion MNIST dataset. It is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. More information can be found at [https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

The 10 categories of fashion items in the dataset are:

0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
