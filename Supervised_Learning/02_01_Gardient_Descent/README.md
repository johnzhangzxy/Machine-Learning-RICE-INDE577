## Data Description

1. **Boston Housing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 506 samples and 13 features. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. The features include crime rate, the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet, the proportion of non-retail business acres per town, and more.

2. **Airline Passengers Dataset**: This dataset contains the number of monthly airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The dataset has a total of 144 observations, and the goal is to predict the number of passengers in the future using an Autoregressive (AR) model.
