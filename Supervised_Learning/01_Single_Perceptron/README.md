## Data Description

The dataset used in this notebook is the 'palmer_penguins.csv', focusing on the Adelie species from the Torgersen island. The data features two measurements: 'bill_depth_mm' and 'bill_length_mm', with the objective of classifying penguins' sex using a Perceptron model. The sex variable is converted to numerical values, mapping "male" to -1 and "female" to 1. The data is normalized by dividing the values by the maximum value of the corresponding variable.
