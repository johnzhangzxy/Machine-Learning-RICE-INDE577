# Data Description

The dataset used in this notebook is generated using the make_moons function from sklearn.datasets. It is an artificial dataset containing 1000 samples with two features and two target classes. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

For the regression trees section, the California Housing dataset is used. It contains 20640 samples with eight features and a continuous target variable representing the median house value. The dataset is also divided into training and testing sets.
